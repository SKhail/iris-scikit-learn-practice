# 🌸 Iris Dataset ML Practice

## 📝 Project Description

This repository contains practice work using the classic **Iris dataset** to build foundational skills in **Machine Learning**. The goal is to explore essential ML concepts through hands-on coding, visualisation, and data analysis.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project serves as a personal learning exercise to:

- Understand how machine learning works with real-world data.
- Explore exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and visualisation.
- Build and evaluate classification models using the Iris dataset.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**
- 🐍 **Python 3.12**
- 🔢 [NumPy]
- 📊 [Pandas]
- 🔬 [SciPy]
- 🎯 [Scikit-learn]
- 🧪 [IPython]
- 📈 [Matplotlib]

## 📁 Contents

- `machine_learning.ipynb` – The main notebook with code, outputs, and explanations.

## 📊 Dataset Info

The **Iris dataset** includes:

- 150 samples of iris flowers
- 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width
- 3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

It is widely used for classification practice due to its simplicity and balance.
